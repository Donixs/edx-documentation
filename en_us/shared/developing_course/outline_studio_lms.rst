Course Progress Information
===========================

The course outline in the LMS also indicates a learner's progress through the
course. A green check mark next to the name of a section, subsection, or unit
indicates that a learner has completed all the following actions in the
section, subsection, or unit.

* Viewed all of each video.
* Submitted answers for all of the problems.
* Viewed all HTML content for at least five seconds.

If a learner selects the **Resume Course** option, the course opens to the
unit that the learner most recently completed.

For information about more specific learner data, including the learner's
grades or answers for individual problems, see :ref:`Manage Student Progress
Index`.
